# Shifting Landscape of Entry-level Technology Roles

## [Goodbye, $165,000 Tech Jobs. Student Coders Seek Work at Chipotle.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/technology/coding-ai-jobs-students.html) By Natasha Singer

This article shows a major **decoupling** between the high demand for talent in AI and the reduced demand for junior software engineers. What is interesting, however, is the statistics presented, which show computer science graduates now have a higher unemployment rate than those in biology or art history majors.

What is most interesting is the change in how companies view efficiency. With the presence of high-performance tools like AI, a single senior developer can now perform the work of several junior assistants. In a sense, it has **raised the floor** in terms of expectations for a new hire. It is no longer sufficient to simply know how to code. The article suggests that the next generation of engineers needs to move from being ***coders*** to being ***system architects*** or ***AI orchestrators***, which involves high-level thinking rather than syntax and debugging.

## Lan's Reflection 
With the demand for junior engineers decreasing, prospective students and job-seekers are facing a daunting question of how keep up, or even compete with AI. This can be a demoralizing shift. A CS degree was once seen as a safe bet, promising high ROI after 4 years of undergrad. Is this article calling for a more intensive curriculum tailored for students to adapt to new technology, or is it simply echoing a broader concern about the profession’s evolution? After all, we saw a similar shift, pre-AI, when tech companies diverted entry-level jobs to offshore outsourcing. This pattern reveals a big question for next-gens: do we jump boats or continue this upstream battle?
